# Always on Display For the Xiaomi Redmi 10.


##Tested in MIUI 13.0.6 / MIUI 12.5.26


Hello Everybody, after some testing I was finally able to make this work. Always on display for our beloved Xiaomi Redmi 10.

I ported this from an already available magisk module for the Poco X3 Pro, Created by Azukabieks.

Works really well and the notification light-up thing also works, but with a catch.

Unfortunatly It remains on all the time. The 10 second option is missing. And Due to the fact that this phone has an IPS Display it consumes a lot of battery. This is more a proof-of-concept than anything else. Feel free to try it out and tell me your thoughts!

Sorry for my Bad English, I am from Portugal.
